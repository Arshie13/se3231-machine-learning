1. Why did you choose this dataset?
    Answer: I chose this dataset because I thought
            this would be the easiest out of
            the three options huhu.

2. What is your conclusion upon conducting linear regression on this dataset?
    Answer: Linear Regression is not suitable for this kind of dataset
            because the the grade is not really linearly dependent to
            most of the independent variables.

3. How relevant is linear regression today?
    Answer: Linear Regression is still relevant today but it does have
            its limitations. When given datasets have strong linear relationships,
            linear regression remains an excellent choice. However,
            real-world data is rarely linear. Many problems (such as the ones given in this activity)
            have non-linear relationships that linear regression fails to capture.
